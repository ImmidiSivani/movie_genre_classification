# movie_genre_classification

# Project Overview
This project aims to classify movie genres based on textual descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. It leverages TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to transform text data into numerical features and applies the Multinomial Naïve Bayes (NB) algorithm for classification.

# Workflow
1.  Data Collection: A dataset containing movie descriptions and corresponding genres is used.
2.   Text Preprocessing:

       1.  Convert text to lowercase



       2. Apply TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical form
     
      
  3. Model Training: Train a Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier on the processed text data.
     
      
4. Model Evaluation:  Use accuracy and classification reports to measure model performance.
